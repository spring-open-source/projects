    Client "I want to login"
    Server generates a random number #S and sends it to the Client
    Client
        reads username and password typed by the user
        calculates the hash of the password, getting h(pw) (which is what is stored in the DB)
        generates another random number #C
        concatenates h(pw) + #S + #C and calculates its hash, call it h(all)
        sends to the server username, #C and h(all)
    Server
        retrieves h(pw)' for the specified username, from the DB
        now it has all the elements to calculate h(all'), like Client did
        if h(all) = h(all') then h(pw) = h(pw)', almost certainly

No one can repeat the request to log in as the specified user. #S adds a variable component to the hash, each time (it's fundamental). #C adds additional noise in it.
